        <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis">Axis</a> is an Open Source project
        that provides the fundamentals for SOAP services.  One of the pieces
        missing from the Axis puzzle currently is easy deployment of existing
        java classes and components as SOAP services.  The AxisService seeks
        to fulfill this need by allowing easy deployment of SOAP services
        at runtime without generated stubs or classes.

        There are two ways to use the AxisService.  You can either use it
        to configure services <a href="./dynamic.html">dynamically</a>.  Or
        you can use it with the standard <a href="./wsdd.html">WSDD Configuration</a>.
