        Ivory provides easy integration between your exiting java classes, Avalon
        services, and Axis.  It allows easy deployment of soap services with none
        of the WSDD configuration that Axis normally mandates.  Simply register
        your class or service and wa-la, you have a new RPC SOAP service.
        However, it also allows Avalon services to be used with the standard
        WSDD configuration easily.

        There are two ways to use the AxisService.  You can either use it
        to configure services <a href="./dynamic.html">dynamically</a>.  Or
        you can use it with the standard <a href="./wsdd.html">WSDD Configuration</a>.
