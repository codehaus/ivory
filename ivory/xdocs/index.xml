        Ivory provides easy integration between your exiting java classes, Avalon
        services, and Axis.  It allows easy deployment of soap services with none
        of the WSDD configuration that Axis normally mandates.  
		Simply register
        your class or service and viola, you have a new RPC SOAP service.
        Ivory also allows Avalon services to be used with the standard
        WSDD configuration easily.
