    <section name="Axis Metadata Directives">
      <p>
        Because Java and XML don't always match up the Axis component now allows
        you to put metadata in your code thanks to
        <a href="http://qdox.sourceforge.net">QDox</a> and
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/attributes">Common's
        Attributes</a>.  There are two directives you can put in your code currently.
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Directive</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>@axis.serialize.[param] [ObjectType]</td>
              <td>
                This directive tells the component to serialize the specified parameter
                [param] as the specified [ObjectType].  This needs to be done for any
                method that takes or returns a List.  Axis needs to know what kind
                of array to serialize the List to.  For example, specifying
                "@axis.serialize.out [Ljava.lang.String;" would mean serialize the
                returned List as an array of Strings.  Or 
                "@axis.serialize.in0 [Lcom.company.Employee;" would mean serialize the
                first parameter for the method as an array of Employee objects.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>@axis.hidemethod</td>
              <td>
                This directive tells the the Axis component to not expose the
                method as a web service.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also some serializers that support metadata for any bean
        (not just your service).  These are largely untested and are located
        in the org.codehuas.axis.serialize package.
