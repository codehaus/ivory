      <p>
        A long time back, a 
        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12903">patch</a>
        was filed by Marcus Crafter for Axis that  has been incorporated into 
        Ivory (with some modification) to allow Avalon services to be used
        as an Axis service with ease.  It requires two things:
        <ol>
          <li>You use the Axis component provided that embeds axis.  This is because
              currently it is in charge of registerring the AvalonProvider with
              Axis.  There are better ways to do this - patches are accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding the Avalon Provider to your WSDD configuration. See below.
          </li>
        </ol>
        NOTE: Unlike the original patch, this patch uses the ServiceManager 
        instead of Component Manager.

      <p>
        To use the Avalon provider, just register your service in your WSDD:
      </p>
      <p>
<source><![CDATA[
<deployment ...>
  <handler name="AvalonDispatcher" type="java:org.codehaus.axis.provider.AvalonProvider"/>
   .
   .
  <service name="YourService" provider="java:Avalon">
   .
   .
   .
  </service>
</deployment>
]]></source>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget to specify your WSDD file in the Ivory component 
        <a href="./dynamic.html#Configuration Method">configuration.</a>
